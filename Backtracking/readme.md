# Backtracking Algorithm

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique used to find solutions to problems incrementally by exploring all possible options and eliminating those that fail to satisfy constraints. It is commonly used in combinatorial problems such as permutations, subsets, and puzzles.

## How Backtracking Works

Backtracking follows these steps:
1. **Choose**: Select a potential option to explore.
2. **Explore**: Recursively explore the chosen option.
3. **Backtrack**: If the option does not lead to a valid solution, undo the last choice and try the next possible option.

## Pseudocode
```python
# Generic backtracking template
def backtrack(path, choices):
    if goal_reached(path):  # Base condition
        result.append(path[:])  # Store a valid solution
        return

    for choice in choices:
        if is_valid(choice):  # Check constraints
            path.append(choice)  # Make a choice
            backtrack(path, choices)  # Recur
            path.pop()  # Undo choice (Backtrack)
```

## Applications of Backtracking
- **Generating permutations and subsets**
- **Solving the N-Queens problem**
- **Sudoku solver**
- **Word search problems**
- **Graph coloring problems**


## Complexity Analysis
| Problem Type | Time Complexity |
|-------------|----------------|
| Subset Generation | O(2^N) |
| Permutations | O(N!) |
| Sudoku Solver | O(9^K), where K is the number of empty cells |

## Optimizations in Backtracking
- **Pruning**: Avoid unnecessary paths by checking constraints early.
- **Memoization**: Store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Branch and Bound**: Cut off branches that cannot lead to optimal solutions.
