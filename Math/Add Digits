Tips: 
• Any number which is divisible by 9 has the sum of digits adding up to 9 always.
• Therefore, the digital root for any number divisible by 9 is always 9.
• The digital root (ans) for 0 is always 0.
• For any number that isn't 0 and isn't divisible by 9, the digital root (ans) will always be n % 9, where n is the given number.


class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        # optimal O(1)
        if num < 9:
            return num
        elif num % 9 == 0:
            return 9
        else:
            return num % 9
