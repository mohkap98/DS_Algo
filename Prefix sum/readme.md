How to Compute Prefix Sum:

Create a new array prefixSum of the same size as the original array.
prefixSum[0] = originalArray[0]
For every index i from 1 to n-1, prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + originalArray[i]

Benefits of Prefix Sum:

Quickly find the sum of any subarray using just two array lookups.
Helps in reducing the time complexity of summing over subarrays from O(n) to O(1).
